## Prism Nova (`arcane/prism-nova`)

![Prism Nova](renders/prism-nova/anim.gif)

A crystal prism forms in the air, catches a shaft of light and rakes a rainbow fan across the floor,
then overloads, cracks and bursts into spectral shards. One-shot, 2.9 s, 30 fps, 280 x 160 px.

- `effects/arcane/prism-nova.js`: the effect source. Copy it to `src/fx/arcane/` in a pixelfx checkout.
- `renders/prism-nova/prism-nova.png` + `.json`: sprite sheet (88 frames, 8 columns, Aseprite-style JSON).
  Pivot `[112, 134]` (the floor under the prism), 30 fps, no loop. Use nearest filtering.
- `renders/prism-nova/contact.png`: frames at a glance.

Options: `palette` (crystal ramp, dark to bright), `spectrum` (the 7 rainbow colors), `seed`.

```sh
node tools/render.mjs arcane/prism-nova --gif
node tools/render.mjs arcane/prism-nova --sheet --opts '{"spectrum":["#ff2a6a","#ff6ad0","#c06aff","#7a6aff","#4aa0ff","#4affe0","#ffffff"]}'
```
